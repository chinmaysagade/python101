    "### Introduction to  Python\n",
    "Python is an easy and fully functional programming language which is highly useful for scripting and rapid application development. It's syntax and semantics makes it   flexible to use for one-off scripting or do large scale enterprise frameworks. The original python was released in 1991 (4 yrs before java).\n",
    "In python, you can do both procedure-oriented as well as object-oriented programming. \n",
    "Python is open-sourced and you can find the source at:  \n",
    "https://github.com/python/cpython/\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In procedure-oriented languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In object-oriented languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.\n",

In this way, Python is actually a hybrid language (Java is another example in this category).CPython creates .pyc for impoted files which are cached bytecode files. If a source file is not imported, then no pyc file is created, but there are ways to generate byte codes."
